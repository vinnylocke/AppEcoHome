# Home screen redesign — stats cull + locations consolidation + anti-AI/bloat sweep

**Status:** Plan — all 4 decisions LOCKED (§G). Awaiting build approval for Stage 1. No application code written.
**User brief (three asks):** (1) the home shows a lot of statistics — useful or bloat? (2) the "Locations" tab overlaps with location management *and* the home garden grid — consolidate into one (ideally the home screen) with easy add/manage of locations + sub-areas; (3) another deep dive to cut bloat, look less AI-generated, and surface useful features.

Grounded by a 4-agent recon deep-dive (stats inventory, locations trilemma, bloat/AI/a11y sweep, technical grounding) + a synthesis pass. Every claim below traces to a `file:line` from that recon. One load-bearing claim independently re-verified by me (the LocationPage permission leak — see §F).

---

## A. App-reference consulted

`02-dashboard/17-home-main.md`, `02-dashboard/02-locations-tab.md`, `02-dashboard/07-location-page.md`, `03-garden-hub/03-location-manager.md`, `03-garden-hub/04-area-details.md`, `07-management/02-members-permissions.md`, `99-cross-cutting/01-data-model-home.md`, `02-data-model-spatial.md`, `19-rls-patterns.md`, `21-routing.md`, `34-accessibility.md`, `40-design-system.md`; plus source end-to-end for `GardenSnapshot`, `GardenOverviewGrid`, `AreaRow`, `LocationOverviewCard`, `LocationTile`, `LocationPage`, `LocationManager`, `AddAreaWizard`, `HomeStatusStrip`, `dashboardStats.ts`, and the App.tsx dashboard branch.

**Doc drift found (fix in-task):** `02-locations-tab.md` still describes the old `LocationTile` grid, but `?view=locations` now renders the same `GardenOverviewCard` stat-quadrant cards as the home grid. `02-data-model-spatial.md` uses `is_outdoor`/`ph`; the columns are `is_outside`/`medium_ph`. `07-location-page.md` claims an Add-Area button + microclimate strip that don't exist.

## B. Stats verdict — "a stat earns its pixels only if a gardener would *do something different today* because of it"

### Keep (the good part — the hero, porch sentence, and grid's decision-numbers)
`X/Y today`, `N overdue` (the one duplication that earns itself), current temp+condition, `frost N°`, the porch status sentence, per-location tasks-today chip, AreaRow growth-state dots, soil-sensor chip, valve chip, the 7-day day-strip (**promote** out of the wall), Week Ahead sow/harvest chips, The Brief narrative rows, the nav overdue badge.

### Demote (orientation metadata — must stop competing typographically with decision-numbers)
- Golden-hour/sunset clock — porch whisper-line only; today it sits at peer rank with tasks/frost (`HomeStatusStrip.tsx:239-243`).
- Location subtitle `Outdoors · 3 areas · 12 plants` — must not out-weight the tasks chip (`LocationOverviewCard.tsx:74-76`).

### Cut / merge (grid duplication)
- AreaRow bare plant-count `N` — **cut**; triple-redundant with the dots + subtitle (`AreaRow.tsx:182-184`).
- AreaRow state-breakdown text `3 flowering · 2 seedling` — **cut**; the coloured dots directly above already say this (`AreaRow.tsx:155-159`).
- Per-area tasks chip — **merge**; only show when it disagrees with the per-location chip (`AreaRow.tsx:138-144`).

### The Garden Snapshot stat wall — **gut it, don't tidy it**
Of ~25 tiles in `GardenSnapshot.tsx`, roughly two-thirds are retrospective vanity or duplicate facts the hero/nav/attention-row already own:
- **Cut (vanity/analytics):** Total Tasks, Completed + `%rate`, Done-automatically, Streak, Plants-Harvested + yield, Plants-Pruned/General-Pruning, Weather-Alerts (banner owns alerts by design), Skipped-(rained), all automation tiles, Plant-Doctor-sessions, per-member breakdown.
- **Merge (duplicate of hero/nav/attention/Week-Ahead):** Overdue tile, Pending tile, Harvests-Due, Pruning-Due.
- **Demote:** carried-over/completed-this-week, category chips (nav filters wearing count clothes → Calendar/Routines), Active-Plants (the grid *is* the census), rainfall.
- **Promote out of the collapsed wall:** the **7-day day-strip** → a small forward-looking "week shape" card; **New Watchlist alerts** → an attention-row card (a collapsed panel is the worst home for an alert).

**Net:** the home keeps every number that answers "what now / what next" and sheds the entire scoreboard.

## C. Locations consolidation — "the grid is the garden, and you manage it in place"

### The problem
Five overlapping location surfaces. The **Locations tab** (`?view=locations`) is ~90% redundant with the **home garden grid** — both render one-card-per-location from the same App `locations` state and both tap through to the same `?locationId=X`; the grid is a strict superset (areas, growth dots, telemetry). **LocationManager** (`/management`) is the *sole* CRUD owner, so add-location and the only working add-area path (`AddAreaWizard`, one button at `LocationManager.tsx:566`) are buried a route away. Three surfaces gesture at "add an area" but **two are decoys** (they just navigate; LocationPage's empty state literally says "Go to Settings › Location Management").

### Recommended design
Make the **home garden grid the single "what's growing where + manage it here" surface**; retire the redundant Locations tab; give the drill-in the add-area affordance it lacks; demote LocationManager from "only path" to optional power-user bulk view.

```
HomeMain › home-garden-section
  ├─ GardenOverviewGrid
  │    ├─ section header → home-add-location-btn   (gated can("locations.create")) → AddLocationModal
  │    └─ LocationOverviewCard
  │         ├─ header kebab → location-manage-{id}  (Rename / Inside-Outside / Delete)
  │         └─ AreaRow
  │              ├─ area-manage-{id}                (Metrics / Rename / Delete)
  │              └─ area-add-{locationId}           (launches AddAreaWizard IN PLACE)
  └─ home-empty-garden (3-CTA; "Create a location" opens the modal, not a route)

LocationPage (?locationId=) — the detail/edit host
  ├─ + real Add-Area button (wire AddAreaWizard; kills the "go to Management" dead-end)
  ├─ AreaDetails = the single area-metrics + plant editor
  └─ thread usePermissions so env-toggle + area-delete stop being ungated (§F)
```

**Shared extractions first (one code path for both surfaces):** `AddLocationForm` (lift from `LocationManager.tsx:440-480`), one `AreaManageMenu`, one `AddAreaWizard` launcher hook. Because `LocationOverviewCard` headers and `AreaRow`s are single navigation `<button>`s today, every manage affordance is a **nested button with `stopPropagation`** (mirroring `LocationPage.tsx:292-300`).

**Locations tab → retired.** Drop it from the switcher (→ Dashboard / Calendar / Weather), keep the `dashboard-view-switcher` testid (tour step-1 anchor), and make `?view=locations` **fall through to home** exactly like legacy `?view=overview` (App.tsx:513-539). Delete `LocationTile.tsx`.

**`/management` → kept as an optional power-user bulk view** (recommended — see §E Q1). Zero-cost orphan route; uniquely feeds Plant Doctor's garden-layout AI page-context + cross-feature metadata chips; hosts the `add_location_and_area` manual tour. Keep it in the Dashboard nav `matchPaths`; keep `/management?open=add-location` working; also point the home empty-CTA at the new inline modal.

**Runner-up (rejected for now): fully retire `/management` → redirect to `/dashboard`.** Cleaner on paper but forces three load-bearing migrations in the same change (re-home Plant Doctor's garden-layout context, re-anchor the tour + rewrite `home_setup_tips` copy, repoint `?open=add-location` + strip nav matchPaths) for marginal benefit. Retire later as a follow-up once the home owns everything.

## D. Bloat / anti-AI / a11y — ranked cuts

1. **[HIGH · one sweep] Adopt the `Card` primitive + `status-*` tokens + green-tinted `shadow-card`.** Every home card hand-rolls `bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-sm border` with four different border recipes; `shadow-sm` is a neutral-black shadow the system forbids (`40-design-system.md:24/81`). One near-mechanical swap re-tints shadows, unifies radius/border, and folds in the hover fix (#8).
2. **[HIGH · a11y] Fix sub-AA contrast on the porch status sentence** — the line that *is* the summary renders at `on-surface/60` ≈ 3.4:1 (`HomeStatusStrip.tsx:235`). Lift to `/80` or solid `on-surface-variant` (~7:1); reserve `/35–/45` for genuinely decorative eyebrows.
3. **[HIGH · a11y] Migrate status chips to `status-*` families** — AttentionRow + AreaRow soil/valve chips use raw Tailwind palette that **bypasses High Contrast mode** (`40-design-system.md:77`) on exactly the cards that flag failed automation / dry soil.
4. **[HIGH · anti-AI] Cut the over-labeling; vary hierarchy** — ~6 identical `font-black uppercase tracking-widest /40` eyebrows over near-identical white cards is *the* template-generated tell. Drop redundant labels ("Your garden" over a location grid), keep a couple as true section headers, let whitespace + card size separate the rest.
5. **[HIGH · buried feature] Raise the task-board entry point** — full task management is behind a faint 11px "See all" link (`HomeMain.tsx:322`) yet ticking tasks is the highest-frequency action. Make it a real button both postures; surface inline complete/snooze on the compact list (see §E Q3).
6. **[MED · anti-AI] Replace the emoji valve icon + generic NBA copy** — `⚠` emoji in a Lucide-only system (`AreaRow.tsx:82`) → Lucide `AlertTriangle`; NBA filler body ("tick it off and you're winning") → carry the actual plant/area name + concrete step, or drop it.
7. **[MED · a11y] Fix the posture toggle** — two 14px icon-only buttons, `title` but no `aria-label`, ~26px target (`HomeMain.tsx:198-219`), under the 44px floor. Add labels, pad to ≥44px, consider `SegmentedTabs`.
8. **[MED · craft] Sweep bare `hover:` → `can-hover:`/`active:` twin** — folds into #1; kills sticky-hover-after-tap on the now-default phone posture.
9. **[LOW · craft] Cap live-animation budget** — multiple `animate-pulse` valve dots exceed the ≤1-live-element budget; static filled dot + "Watering" text suffices. Expose "Ask AI" on the Porch too, or remove (don't gate to power users).

## E. Staged build order (each stage ships + verifies independently)

- **Stage 1 — Craft sweep** (Card primitive + status tokens + contrast + hover). **Risk LOW**, near-mechanical, no logic change; resolves D#1/2/3/6-emoji/7/8/9. Testids untouched → dashboard e2e stays green. **✅ DONE 2026-07-20** — card surfaces → house tokens (green `shadow-card`, unified radius/border) across NextBestAction/TheBrief/AdaptiveCare/GardenBrainBrief/LocationOverviewCard/SeasonalPicks/HomeMain-empty; AttentionRow + AreaRow soil/valve + hazard chips → `status-*` families + **added HC-mode `status-*`→`-ink-strong` overrides in index.css** (the migration only delivers HC support with this — verified the block previously handled only on-surface opacities); porch sentence `/60`→`on-surface-variant`; sun line `/35`→`/55`; posture toggle a11y (aria-label/pressed + ≥44px + shadow-card); valve emoji→Lucide AlertTriangle; running-valve dot static; bare `hover:`→`can-hover:` on home surfaces. Verified: typecheck, unit 1555/144, build, home-main e2e 9/9, both postures visually. No testids/labels changed. **Fresh review = ship; fixes applied:** soil_dry attention chip water→caution (blue meant "wet" in AreaRow but "dry" in AttentionRow on one screen — now blue = water present everywhere); hero danger segment `text-red-700`→`text-status-danger-ink` (was bypassing HC); sun line `/55`→`/70` (now ~5.9:1, clears AA); inner-button bg/opacity hovers (empty-garden CTAs, AdaptiveCare, GardenBrainBrief) → `can-hover:` + `active:`. Left as-is: low_battery/automation_failed both `caution` (icons distinguish).
- **Stage 2 — Gut the stat wall.** **Risk LOW–MED.** Delete vanity+duplicate tiles; promote day-strip → standalone card; route watchlist alert → attention row. Do **not** add a second `useHomeDashboardStats` consumer (uncached edge fn). Cull `dashboardStats.test.ts` against tested semantics.
- **Stage 3 — Grid trim + telemetry dedup.** **Risk LOW.** Cut AreaRow bare count + state-text; merge per-area tasks chip; demote subtitle + golden-hour typographically.
- **Stage 4 — Locations consolidation: retire the tab + shared extractions + inline add-location.** **Risk MED.** Retire tab (fall-through), extract `AddLocationForm`, add `home-add-location-btn` + per-card manage kebab — **all `can()`-gated** (viewer/member/owner split preserved: member = create+edit not delete; viewer = none). Delete `LocationTile.tsx`. **New permission e2e** covering the split.
- **Stage 5 — Drill-in becomes the edit host: wire AddAreaWizard + reconcile metrics + close the permission leak.** **Risk MED–HIGH** (touches the one working area-create path + the latent leak). Wire `AddAreaWizard` into LocationPage + grid; **do not remove the existing `LocationManager.tsx:566` wizard entry until the new ones are wired + tested** (the current home/drill-in "add area" are decoys). Pick ONE area-metrics editor (§E Q4). Thread `usePermissions` into LocationPage's env-toggle + area-delete. Note `sync-areas-to-shapes` cron: renaming/moving areas mirrors into `garden_shapes` labels.

---

## F. Verified security finding (raises Stage-5 importance)

`LocationPage.tsx` has **no** `usePermissions` import and directly mutates `is_outside` at line 141 with **no `can()` check**; `LocationManager.tsx` correctly gates every mutation. RLS enforces only home-membership, not the spatial permission keys (`19-rls-patterns.md`), so the client gate is the only gate — a viewer/member can currently flip a location's indoor/outdoor flag (which drives weather-rule applicability). Stage 5 closes this; the consolidation must not widen it.

---

## G. Decisions — LOCKED (user, 2026-07-20)

1. **`/management` → KEEP** as an optional power-user bulk view (recommended path). No redirect; nav `matchPaths` + `?open=add-location` + the `add_location_and_area` tour all stay intact.
2. **Culled stats → DELETE OUTRIGHT.** No relocation to `/gardener?tab=stats`. The vanity *and* retrospective tiles (streak, %rate, doctor-sessions, per-member, yield, harvest/prune totals, automation counts, etc.) simply disappear from the home. Only the 7-day day-strip is promoted (→ standalone forward-looking card) and New Watchlist alerts route to the attention row. **→ Simplifies Stage 2 to a pure deletion + two promotions (no stats-tab wiring).**
3. **Porch task actions → INLINE complete/snooze on the home's compact list** (recommended). Accepts a little task-mutation back on the home; the compact `TaskList` already owns the complete/snooze logic, so it's an exposure change, not new logic. **→ Folds into Stage 3 (now "Grid trim + home task-list accessibility").**
4. **Single area-metrics editor → `AreaDetails` (the drill-in).** LocationManager's separate Area-Metrics modal retires in Stage 5.

### Stage adjustments from the locked decisions
- **Stage 2 — Gut the stat wall (now pure delete):** delete the vanity + retrospective clusters outright; promote the day-strip → standalone card; route the watchlist alert → attention row. No `/gardener?tab=stats` changes. If the `home-dashboard-stats` payload can shrink accordingly, update `10-edge-functions-catalogue.md` + the Deno test; otherwise leave the edge fn and just stop rendering.
- **Stage 3 — Grid trim + home task-list accessibility:** the grid trims (bare count, state-text, per-area chip merge, subtitle/golden-hour demote) **plus** the task-board entry point becomes a real button both postures **and** inline complete/snooze on the compact `TaskList` (Q3). Risk bumps to **MED** (task mutation surfaces on the home). New e2e for inline complete/snooze from the home.
- **Stages 1, 4, 5** unchanged from §E (with `/management` kept per Q1 and `AreaDetails` as the sole metrics editor per Q4).
