# Garden Brain — Adaptive Care (Phase 1) + the Daily Brief (Phase 2) + Photo Scanning (Phase 3)

> Rhozly learns YOUR garden. **Phase 1 (adaptive care):** a nightly deterministic reconciler joins measured soil reality (sensor drydown profiles + readings) with plant needs (`plants.soil_moisture_min/max`) and the home's watering coverage (blueprints + valve automations), then proposes one-tap, **verified** schedule adjustments on the dashboard. **Phase 2 (Daily Brief):** every signal — tasks, care adjustments, weather, windows, failed automations, insights, batteries, and the good news — assembled into ONE ranked morning brief; Sage/Evergreen get the AI head-gardener voice (tier model ladders), everyone else the same brief with template copy. **Phase 3 (photo scanning):** each new plant-linked journal photo gets ONE overnight vision pass bound to a closed action vocabulary — growth stage, health, findings, and at most two auto-applicable recommendations rendered on the plant's Photo Timeline and flagged in the brief. Strategy: [`docs/plans/garden-brain-strategy.md`](../../plans/garden-brain-strategy.md); plans: [`phase 1`](../../plans/garden-brain-phase1-adaptive-care.md) · [`phase 2`](../../plans/garden-brain-phase2-head-gardener-brief.md) · [`phase 3`](../../plans/garden-brain-phase3-photo-timeline.md).
>
> **Relationship to the Head Gardener AI Manager** (`synthesize-garden-brief` / `garden-manager-report` / `head-gardener-chat`, Evergreen): that suite is the standing *strategy* layer (goals, Estate Report); the Daily Brief is the Garden Brain's *operational* morning note. When a `garden_brief` (goals) row exists, the Daily Brief's AI prose honours it.

## Phase 2 — the Daily Brief

- **Pure core** `_shared/dailyBrief.ts`: `assembleBrief(signals)` — deterministic scoring table (overdue 100 > care proposals 90 > **photo flags 85** > weather 80 > windows 70 > failed automations 65 > insights 50 > battery 40), items capped at 6, each with a `reason` + deep-link `route`; **weather items dedupe by alert `type`** (2026-07-22 — `weather_alerts` rows are per `(location, type)`, so a home with several outdoor locations would otherwise repeat e.g. "Hot days ahead" once per location); good news (≤2 lines) from `verified_good`, `in_range` areas, completion streaks (`verified_mixed` is deliberately NOT celebrated); template summary for the non-AI tiers; `prependBriefToDigest` (first sentence only; absent brief → digest body unchanged); `dropResolvedWindows(windows, resolvedIds)` — pure filter the Generator uses to remove harvest/pruning windows the user has already finished this season (see Generator).
- **Actionable items** (`BriefItemAction`, Phase 3 amendment): care-proposal items carry `{ type: 'apply_care_adjustment', adjustmentId }` and photo flags `{ type: 'open_photo_actions', observationId }`. Set ONLY by the deterministic assembler — the AI rewrite reconstructs items from the deterministic array, so an action survives verbatim and the model can never author or alter one. The card renders an inline **Apply** (`daily-brief-item-apply`) that re-fetches the adjustment (`fetchCareAdjustment` — null when no longer `proposed` → "already handled") and applies via the **shared** `src/lib/careAdjustments.ts`, the exact code path the AdaptiveCareCard uses, so the two surfaces cannot drift.
- **Generator** `generate-daily-brief` (cron 04:30 UTC, after the 03:45 reconcile; activity-filtered — homes with member `user_events` in 7 days): every eligible home gets the deterministic brief; **Sage/Evergreen owners** additionally get the AI voice via `modelsForTier(tier)` (Evergreen's 3.1-pro ladder stays exclusive) — the model may only REWRITE summary/reasons (same item count/order enforced; shape mismatch or any error → deterministic fallback, so a brief always exists). Grounded on `buildUserContext` + `garden_brief.goals`; metered via `logAiUsage` (ok/fallback). Upsert on `(home_id, brief_date)`. **Window signal is completion-aware (2026-07-23):** `gatherSignals` cross-checks `tasks` and drops any harvest/pruning window whose task is `Completed`/`Skipped` and still covers today (blueprint_id match; `window_end_date >= today` scopes it to *this* year's cycle, so a finished window stops nagging while next year's stays free to open). The drop lives in the generator — the pure `assembleBrief` only renders the windows it is handed — and mirrors the dashboard's DONE-set suppression in `_shared/dashboardStats.ts`.
- **Regenerate** (`{ homeId, regenerate: true, feedback? }`): authenticated member + **Sage+ (403 below)** + `enforceRateLimit`; feedback threads into the prompt (the regenerate-with-feedback grounding requirement).
- **Storage** `daily_briefs` (PK `(home_id, brief_date)`; members SELECT via RLS + grant; service-role writes). `generated_by: 'deterministic'|'ai'`, `model`, `tier` recorded per row.
- **Card** `src/components/home/GardenBrainBriefCard.tsx` ("Your daily brief" — since home redesign **Stage 3** (2026-07-20) it renders `embedded` as the FIRST row of **The Brief** (`the-brief`), HomeMain's one merged "From Rhozly" AI card, in both densities; its root testid was **renamed `daily-brief-card` → `garden-brain-brief`** in the same stage; it reports self-visibility to The Brief via `onVisibilityChange`): summary + ranked items (simple: top 3; detailed: all + reasons), good-news block, 👍/👎 → `ai_feedback` (`function_name: 'generate-daily-brief'`, `target_kind: 'daily_brief'`), 👎 opens a comment box; **Refresh only renders on AI briefs**. Snapshot-cached (`rhozly:snap:v1:daily-brief:{homeId}`); shows nothing when today's/yesterday's brief is absent. testids: `garden-brain-brief` (root) + `daily-brief-summary/-item-{kind}/-goodnews/-thumbs-up/-thumbs-down/-refresh/-feedback-input` (inner testids unchanged).
- **Chat**: `get_daily_brief` read tool (auto, sprout+ — reads the stored row, no AI call) grounds "what should I do today?".
- **Morning push**: `daily-batch-notifications` prepends the brief's first sentence to the existing task digest (absent → unchanged; UTC-today key — the 04:30 generator precedes any 08:00-local digest).
- **Ops**: cron functions MUST be in `supabase/config.toml` `verify_jwt = false` — `garden-brain-reconcile` was added retroactively (its first prod cron would have 401'd) alongside `generate-daily-brief` and `scan-journal-photos`.

---

## Phase 3 — Photo Timeline scanning

- **Pure core** `_shared/scanJournalPhotos.ts`: the CLOSED action vocabulary (`create_task` | `check_for_ailment` | `watch_closely` — nothing else exists), `PHOTO_OBSERVATION_SCHEMA` (Gemini `responseSchema`, JSON mode — deviation is impossible at the API layer), `validateObservation` (defence in depth: unknown kinds dropped, ≤2 actions, `due_in_days` clamped 0–14, `create_task` requires a valid `task_type` ∈ Watering/Pruning/Maintenance/Harvesting + title, reason ≤160 / findings ≤200 chars, unusable core → null, no row), `selectPhotos` (plant-linked + has image + **never observed before** + ≤14 days old, oldest first, ≤10/home/night), `shouldApplyStage` (confidence ≥0.8 AND stage differs), `buildPhotoPrompt` ("a healthy plant should usually have NO actions").
- **Scanner** `scan-journal-photos` (cron **04:00 UTC**, between the 03:45 reconcile and the 04:30 brief; on-demand `{ homeId }`): activity-filtered homes → **owner tier ∈ sage/evergreen** → un-analysed journal photos → image fetched server-side (`journal-photos` bucket is public; 8 MB / mime guards) → `callGeminiCascade` with `DEFAULT_MODELS` (flash-lite ladder — cheap per photo), temp 0.2, the responseSchema → validate → INSERT `photo_observations` (UNIQUE `journal_id` = one analysis ever) → high-confidence stage mismatch auto-corrects `inventory_items.growth_state` (`stage_applied` audit flag). `logAiUsage` ok/error per call. No `GEMINI_API_KEY` → clean no-op.
- **Storage** `photo_observations`: `journal_id UNIQUE`, `growth_stage` (8-stage CHECK matching `inventory_items.growth_state`), `health` (`healthy|watch|concern`), `findings`, `confidence`, `stage_applied`, `actions jsonb` (each action carries `status: proposed|applied|dismissed` + `applied_task_id`), `model`. RLS: members SELECT/UPDATE, service INSERT; grants SELECT, UPDATE to authenticated.
- **Surface** `src/components/PhotoTimelineTab.tsx` (plant detail → Photos): health chip on analysed tiles (`photo-observation-chip`; emerald/amber/rose), full panel in the lightbox (`photo-observation-panel`) — stage + health + findings + each action with **Apply / Dismiss** (`photo-action-apply` / `photo-action-dismiss`). Apply: `create_task` → offline-safe `insertOrQueue` one-off task (due = today + `due_in_days`, linked to the plant + its area/location) with `applied_task_id` written back; `check_for_ailment` → marks applied + routes to Plant Doctor; `watch_closely` → "Got it" acknowledge. Every apply/dismiss writes an `ai_feedback` signal (`function_name: 'scan-journal-photos'`, rating ±1). Sub-Sage sees an upsell line (`photo-observation-upsell`) instead of observations.
- **Brief integration**: `concern` observations from the last 24 h surface as `photo_flag` items (score 85) with an `open_photo_actions` action → "See photo" deep-links to the Shed.
- **Why it can't hallucinate actions**: responseSchema restricts output to the closed enums at generation time; `validateObservation` re-enforces server-side; the UI renders only the three known kinds; watering *cadence* is deliberately excluded from the vocabulary — cadence is owned by sensor-backed Phase 1.

## Role 1 — Technical Reference

### Component graph
- `src/components/home/AdaptiveCareCard.tsx` — since redesign Stage 3 (2026-07-20) mounted `embedded` as the second row of **The Brief** (`src/components/home/TheBrief.tsx`, both densities; reports self-visibility via `onVisibilityChange`). Self-hides when no open/verified rows; root testid `adaptive-care-card` unchanged.
- `src/components/GardenerProfile.tsx` — `adaptiveCare` notification category toggle.

### Data flow — read paths
- Card: `care_adjustments` `status='proposed'` (+ last-7-days `verified_*`), painted from snapshot cache `rhozly:snap:v1:adaptive-care:{homeId}` then revalidated.
- Reconciler inputs (service role): `soil_moisture_profiles` (area-mapped, confidence/segments), `device_readings` (last 14 days per device), `inventory_items (status='Planted') → plants(soil_moisture_min/max)`, watering `task_blueprints` (active, per area), valve coverage via `automation_actions(valve_open) → devices.area_id → automations.is_active`, `weather_snapshots` (7-day max temps), recent `care_adjustments` (45 days — cooldown/supersede/verify inputs).

### Data flow — write paths
- Reconciler: INSERT/UPDATE `care_adjustments` (refresh open, supersede stale); verification updates `status/verified_at/verification`; one `notifications` row per member for NEW actionable kinds (tighten/stress/create — never stretch/in_range).
- Card **Apply**: **CAS-claims the row first** — `update(status='applied') WHERE id AND status='proposed' RETURNING id` (bug-audit-2026-07-10 #7); only one caller wins, so tapping Apply on both the dashboard card and the Daily Brief's inline button (or two members) can't run the mutation twice. Then, only if claimed: tighten/stretch → `task_blueprints.frequency_days` update; `create_watering_routine` → blueprint + first task + `BlueprintService.generateBlueprintTasks` (mirrors AddTaskModal's recurring flow). A side-effect failure **reverts the claim to `proposed`** so the suggestion isn't lost. **Dismiss** → `status='dismissed'` + **`dismissed_at`** (the 14-day cooldown keys off the dismissal moment, not `created_at`, so a proposal dismissed weeks after it appeared gets a fresh cooldown — bug-audit #19). Events: `care_adjustment_applied/dismissed`.

### Rule engine (`_shared/adaptiveCare.ts` — pure, no AI)
- Target band = median of the bed's plant ranges (fallback 30–60%). Reality stats over 14 days: `pctTimeBelowFloor`, min, typical post-water peak. `daysToFloor = (peak − floor) / rate`, where rate is **forecast-matched** (`drydown_by_weather.hot_dry` on a hot week — ≥3 days ≥27°C — else overall).
- **Gates:** confidence ≥ 0.5, segments ≥ 3, ≥ 10 reading-days; silent otherwise. Anti-oscillation: tighten needs `freq > daysToFloor×1.25` + suffering (>15% below floor); stretch needs `freq < daysToFloor×0.6` + near-zero floor time + min > floor+10 — deliberately non-adjacent. 14-day dismissal cooldown per (area, kind).
- `create_watering_routine`: only when NO active watering blueprint AND no valve automation covers the area AND the bed shows real need. (The `soilDrydownWatering` pattern flags missing *automation* in insights — different action/surface.)
- Verification: ≥7 post-change reading-days → `verified_good` when below-floor time ≤ max(5%, half the pre-change figure), else `verified_mixed`; numbers stored in `verification` and rendered honestly.

### Cron / scheduled jobs
- `garden-brain-reconcile-daily` — 03:45 UTC (after `compute-soil-profiles` 03:00). On-demand: POST `{ homeId }`.

### Tier gating
- Server-side only: home **owner's** tier ∈ sage/evergreen (`ELIGIBLE_TIERS`). No client tier plumbing — the card hides when no rows exist. Sensors are the practical gate.

### Permissions / RLS
- `care_adjustments`: members SELECT/UPDATE (RLS via `home_members`); INSERT service-role only. Data-API grants: SELECT, UPDATE to authenticated (2026-10 rule).
- `weather_task_claims`-style delete-safety is NOT needed here — the partial unique index (`(home_id, area_id, kind) WHERE status='proposed'`) + supersede logic handle idempotency.

### Error states
- Missing/low-confidence profile → area silently skipped. Apply failure → toast, status unchanged. Notification failure → logged, non-fatal.

### Performance
- Deterministic; per-home queries are index-friendly (`care_adjustments_home_status_idx`). No Gemini calls in Phase 1.

## Role 2 — Expert Gardener's Guide

### Why open this
The Garden Brain card is Rhozly noticing what your soil sensor has been saying all fortnight and turning it into one decision: water more often, water less often, watch that bed this hot week, or set up a routine for a bed that has none. Every suggestion shows its working, and after you apply one Rhozly comes back a week later and tells you — honestly — whether it helped.

### Every flow
1. **Change to every Nd** — the bed dries faster (or slower) than your routine assumes. One tap updates the routine; the schedule regenerates instantly.
2. **Create routine (every Nd)** — plants are in the bed, nothing waters it, and the sensor shows it suffering. One tap creates the watering routine with today as its first day.
3. **Got it** (hot-week stress) — no schedule change; a heads-up that this week's heat will outrun the cadence.
4. **Dismiss** — hides that suggestion for a fortnight. Rhozly won't nag.
5. **✓ Since the change…** — the verification line: soil-in-range % over the week since you applied. Green = worked; amber = mixed (worth a look — maybe the emitter, the plant mix, or the sensor position).

### Information on display
"See the numbers" expands the evidence: the comfort band used (from your plants), % of time below it, the measured drying speed (and whether the hot-weather rate was used), and days-to-floor. If ranges vary across the bed's plants, the middle is used.

### Tier-by-tier
Sprout/Botanist: not available (upgrade surfaces via Integrations). Sage/Evergreen: full.

### Common pitfalls
- No card? You need a soil sensor assigned to an area with planted plants, ~10+ days of readings, and a confident drydown profile. New sensors take a week or two to earn suggestions — by design.
- Sensor in an unrepresentative spot (against the emitter, in a dry corner) → suggestions mirror the sensor, not the bed. Reposition and let the profile rebuild.
