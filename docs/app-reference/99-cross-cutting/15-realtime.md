# Realtime — Supabase Channels, Presence

> Rhozly uses Supabase Realtime (Postgres → WebSocket) to keep multi-device + multi-user state in sync. Each home-scoped table can be subscribed to via the `useHomeRealtime(table, callback)` hook. Presence is used for showing "X is editing this plan" in Plan Staging.

## Quick Summary

```
Postgres ──► Supabase Realtime ──► WebSocket ──► Browser
                                                    │
                                                    └── useHomeRealtime(table, callback)
                                                        triggers callback on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
                                                        scoped via home_id filter

## Role 1 — Technical Reference

### `useHomeRealtime` hook

```ts
useHomeRealtime("plans", refetchPlans);
useHomeRealtime("task_blueprints", refetchBlueprints);
useHomeRealtime("shopping_lists", refetchLists);
useHomeRealtime("shopping_list_items", refetchItems);
useHomeRealtime("integration_devices", refetchDevices);
// etc.
```

Internally:
- Opens a Supabase channel per table.
- Filters by `home_id = currentHomeId`.
- Calls the callback on any change event.
- Cleans up on unmount.

### Channels in active use

| Table | Subscribers |
|-------|-------------|
| `plans` | PlannerDashboard |
| `task_blueprints` | BlueprintManager |
| `shopping_lists` | ShoppingLists hook |
| `shopping_list_items` | ShoppingLists hook |
| `plant_instance_ailments` | AilmentWatchlist — refreshes affected-plant counts when an ailment is linked/unlinked. Added to `HOME_TABLES` + the `supabase_realtime` publication (migration `20260829000000_plant_instance_ailments_realtime.sql`). Low write rate (explicit user action only), so the per-client channel cost is negligible. |
| `integration_devices` | IntegrationsPage |
| `automations` | AutomationsSection |
| `home_dashboard_stats` (if subscribed) | Dashboard |
| `plants` (Wave 1 of AI Plant Overhaul) | `useCachedShed` only — refetch when home-scoped rows change. `useAiPlantFreshness` does NOT yet subscribe to realtime because `useHomeRealtime` filters by `home_id` and global AI plants have `home_id IS NULL`. Wave 5 ships a fetch-on-mount model; freshness only refreshes on page navigation. Realtime on globals is deferred to Wave 7 if cross-device freshness sync becomes important. |
| `user_plant_ack` (Wave 1 of AI Plant Overhaul) | Published in the `supabase_realtime` table set so the channel is available, but no client currently subscribes. Wave 5 uses optimistic local updates from `useAiPlantFreshness.acknowledge()` instead of waiting for a realtime echo. Wave 7 could add a sub for cross-device sync (acknowledging on phone clears chip on desktop immediately). |

### Wear OS companion (separate SDK)

The native Wear app doesn't use `useHomeRealtime` (that's the browser hook) — it opens its own `supabase-kt` Realtime channel `home-tasks-{homeId}` on `tasks`, filtered by `home_id` and authenticated by the watch's session (so **RLS scopes it identically**). On any change it silently re-calls `get-today-tasks` for the viewed day. The channel is ViewModel-scoped (foreground-only) to bound battery. See `wear/app/.../presentation/tasks/TasksViewModel.kt` and docs/wear-os-companion-plan.md §5a.

### Presence (`PresenceAvatars`)

Plan Staging opens a presence channel keyed on `plan.id`. Other users editing the same plan appear as avatar chips.

```ts
const channel = supabase.channel(`plan:${plan.id}`)
  .on("presence", { event: "sync" }, () => { ... })
  .subscribe();
channel.track({ user_id, name, joined_at });
```

### RLS implications

Realtime respects RLS — you only receive events for rows you have read access to.

### Rate limits

Supabase Realtime has connection + message limits per tier. The hook batches subscriptions where possible.

### Reconnection

WebSocket auto-reconnects on flap. Events that occur during the gap are NOT replayed on rejoin — the shared home channel reconciles them itself (see below); pull-to-refresh remains the manual fallback for screens outside it.

### `HomeRealtimeContext` — the shared home channel

`HomeRealtimeContext` opens ONE channel per home (`home-realtime-${homeId}`) that multiplexes postgres_changes subscriptions across a fixed set of home-scoped tables (`HOME_TABLES`). Components register interest via `useHomeRealtime(table, callback)`; the context fans changes out to registered callbacks.

**Status-aware subscribe + gap reconciliation:** the channel subscribes with a status callback. A `CHANNEL_ERROR` / `TIMED_OUT` / `CLOSED` status marks a disconnect gap (supabase-js retries the join itself); when the next `SUBSCRIBED` arrives after a gap, the context fans out **one refetch per registered table** to reconcile whatever events were missed during the outage. Previously the bare `channel.subscribe()` made a failed join (token race at app start, realtime quota) invisible — every "self-refreshing" list stayed static for the whole session.

### `useMaintenanceMode` — polling fallback + race guard

The maintenance-mode hook (`src/hooks/useMaintenanceMode.ts`) is realtime-driven (`app_config` UPDATE events) but no longer depends on a single event to recover:

- **While maintenance is ON**, it polls `app_config` every **30s** and on `visibilitychange`/`online` — deploys are exactly when infrastructure flaps, so if the socket dropped, the one "maintenance off" event was missed and the user stared at the maintenance screen forever. A polled "off" behaves exactly like the realtime event (activate waiting SW, then reload).
- **Initial-fetch race guard:** the slower initial fetch no longer clobbers a realtime event that raced past it (a `realtimeWrote` ref gates the initial fetch's write).

**Scalability Wave D (2026-05-28):** the table set was trimmed from 13 → 11. `weather_snapshots` and `weather_alerts` were removed — they change on an hourly cron, never from user action, so per-client realtime push was pure overhead (realtime server memory + CPU scale with concurrent clients × tables × write rate). The dashboard now refetches weather on tab-focus (throttled to once per 5 min) via a `visibilitychange` handler in `App.tsx` instead. The remaining 11 tables all change from user action and benefit from sub-second cross-client freshness.

### Where Realtime is NOT used

Weather snapshots + alerts (hourly cron — dashboard refetches on tab-focus; removed from realtime in Wave D).
Garden Shapes (single-user editing model — collab edit is a future feature).
Chat messages (single-user; the agent confirm cards hydrate from `chat_tool_calls` on load instead).

## Role 2 — Expert Gardener's Guide

### Why realtime matters

If you and your partner both have Rhozly open and they tick off a task, your screen updates within seconds. No manual refresh.

Presence in Plan Staging tells you "they're looking at this plan right now" — useful for "don't both edit at once".

### Implications

- Most lists self-refresh.
- Some screens (Tasks, Layout) still need pull-to-refresh.
- If realtime drops (network flap), the shared home channel now refetches automatically once it reconnects; pull-to-refresh still forces sync immediately.
