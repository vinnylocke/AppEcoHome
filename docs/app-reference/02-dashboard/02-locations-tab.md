# Locations Tab

> The grid view of every garden location you've set up — quick way to see "what's growing where" and which spots need attention today.

**Route:** `/dashboard?view=locations`
**Source files (entry points):**
- `src/App.tsx` (lines ~1130–1188) — renders the locations grid when `dashboardView === "locations"`
- `src/components/LocationTile.tsx` — individual tile component
- `src/components/LocationPage.tsx` — drill-in view when a location is tapped

---

## Quick Summary

A responsive grid of location cards (one per Location row), each showing today's open task count for that location. Tapping a tile drills into `LocationPage` (rendered inline within the Dashboard route as `/dashboard?locationId=X`). The empty state nudges first-time users to add their first location.

## Role 1 — Technical Reference

### Component graph

```
/dashboard?view=locations (App.tsx)
├── (if dashboardError) Error card with Retry button
├── (loading) 3× skeleton tiles
├── (loaded, empty) "No locations yet" card with MapPin icon + Add Location CTA → /management
└── (loaded, has data) grid of LocationTile components
    ├── LocationTile.props.site             — the location record
    ├── LocationTile.props.index            — for stagger animation
    └── LocationTile.props.tasksCount       — today's task count from locationTaskCounts
```

### Props passed to LocationTile

| Prop | Type | Source | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| `site` | `Location` (id, name, is_outside, areas[], light_intensity_lux, etc.) | App.tsx state.locations | Display name, area count, etc. |
| `index` | `number` | enumerate index | Stagger fade-in animation |
| `tasksCount` | `number \| null` | `locationTaskCounts[loc.id] ?? null` | Today's task badge |

### State (App.tsx-level used here)

| State | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `locations` | `Location[]` | All locations for the active home |
| `locationTaskCounts` | `Record<locationId, number>` | Today's open task count per location |
| `dashboardLoaded` | `boolean` | Has data finished loading at least once |
| `dashboardError` | `boolean` | Last fetch failed |
| `selectedLocationId` | `string \| null` | From `searchParams.get("locationId")` — drives LocationPage drill-in |

### Data flow — read paths

The Locations Tab is purely a render of in-memory state that `fetchDashboardData()` already produced. It makes no additional queries.

The state itself comes from:

- **`home-dashboard-stats` edge function** — returns `locations` array and `location_task_counts` map.
- **`locations_cache_<homeId>` sessionStorage** — fast first paint while the edge fn is loading.

### Data flow — write paths

None directly. Tapping a LocationTile calls `navigate('/dashboard?locationId=X')` which is read-only navigation.

### Edge functions invoked

None directly. Indirectly relies on `home-dashboard-stats` data already loaded by the parent Dashboard route.

### Cron / scheduled jobs that affect this surface

| Cron | Cadence | Affects |
|------|---------|---------|
| `generate-tasks` | Daily AM | `location_task_counts` go up when blueprints fire today |
| `run-automations` | Every 5 min | Automations may auto-complete tasks, decreasing counts |

### Realtime channels

Subscribes (via `DashboardRealtimeSubscriber` in App.tsx) to:
- `locations` table changes → refetch full dashboard
- `inventory_items` changes → light-weight refetch of counts only (`handleInventoryRealtime`)
- `tasks` changes → refresh counts

### Tier gating

Same content for every tier — no Locations Tab gating.

### Beta gating

None.

### Permissions / role-based UI

- The "Add Location" CTA only appears in the empty state — full add UI lives in Location Manager (`/management`). Permission gating happens there, not on this view.

### Error states

| State | Visible result |
|-------|----------------|
| `dashboardError = true` | Red error card with Retry button (`onClick={fetchDashboardData}`) at the top of the grid |
| Loading first time | 3 grey skeleton tiles |
| Loaded + empty | "No locations yet" empty state with Add Location button |
| Loaded + has data + filtered to nothing | Wouldn't apply — no filter on this surface |

### Performance notes

- Grid is `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-5` — single column on mobile, two columns on small+.
- Each LocationTile uses `loading="lazy"` on its image if applicable.
- No virtualisation — assumes < 50 locations per home, which holds in practice.

### Linked storage buckets

None directly.

## Role 2 — Expert Gardener's Guide

### Why open this view

The Locations Tab answers "what's happening where?" For a beginner with one location ("Back Garden") it's the table of contents — tap a location to see the plants inside and what they need. For a power user with separate outdoor beds, indoor windowsills, and a greenhouse, this view is the navigation hub. The task count badge on each tile is the single most useful piece of information — it lets you decide which location needs attention first this morning.

### Every flow on this view

#### 1. Glance the task counts

- **What you see:** each tile shows the location name, area count, and a number badge "3 tasks today" (or no badge if zero).
- **What you do:** read the numbers, decide where to start.
- **Why a gardener cares:** prioritisation. Three pending in the herb bed, zero in the greenhouse → start with herbs.

#### 2. Tap a location tile

- **What happens:** the URL updates to `/dashboard?locationId=X`, and the same Dashboard route renders `LocationPage` instead of the grid.
- **Why a gardener cares:** drill-in view shows the areas inside the location, plants in each area, and per-plant detail without leaving the Dashboard route.

#### 3. Empty-state CTA: "Add Location"

- **What you see (first run):** the centred empty state with the "Add Location" button.
- **What happens:** navigates to `/management` (Location Manager) where you can create your first location.
- **Why a gardener cares:** Rhozly's data model is Home → Locations → Areas → Plants. A location is a logical division of your garden — outdoor borders, polytunnel, conservatory. Areas are subdivisions inside (raised bed 1, herb circle, etc.).

#### 4. Refresh after a real-world change

- **What you see:** counts not matching reality (e.g. you watered everything but the count still says 3).
- **What you do:** pull down to refresh OR tap "Today" on the Dashboard nav button (resets the selected date) OR wait for realtime to catch up.

### Information on display — what every field means

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Location name | Free text you set when creating it |
| Areas count chip | Number of `areas` rows attached to this location |
| Task count badge | Today's pending tasks for tasks where `tasks.location_id = X` AND `status = 'Pending'` |
| `is_outside` flag (icon variant) | Drives weather-rule applicability — outdoor locations get frost / wind / rain alerts |
| Location image (if present) | Custom photo or default tile gradient |

### Tier-by-tier experience

Identical for every tier. No gating on this surface.

### New user vs returning user vs power user

- **Brand new user**: sees the empty state with "No locations yet". The CTA is the single visible action.
- **Returning user** (one location): a single tile fills the row. Tap to drill in.
- **Power user** (5+ locations across indoor / outdoor): the badge density tells you where the day's work concentrates. Multi-column layout shines.

### Beta user experience

No difference.

### Common mistakes / pitfalls

- **Adding too many locations.** Locations are logical garden divisions. "Front garden", "Back garden", "Greenhouse" — not "Tomato bed", "Lavender hedge" (those are *areas* inside a location).
- **Expecting per-plant task counts here.** Counts are per-location. Per-plant is on `LocationPage` and `InstanceEditModal`.
- **Tile order isn't meaningful.** Order is creation order. There's no priority sort. Use the badge counts to decide what to do.

### Recommended workflows

- **Morning glance:** Locations Tab → which tile has the highest badge → tap → handle.
- **Add a new growing area:** open Location Manager from any tile or the empty state; create the location, add areas inside it.

### What to do if something looks wrong

- **A location's count is wrong:** pull-to-refresh. If still wrong, check `locations.id` ↔ `tasks.location_id` matches in the data — easy to verify in Supabase Studio.
- **A location you deleted still shows:** realtime should pick this up; if it doesn't, refresh. Confirm the delete actually committed.
